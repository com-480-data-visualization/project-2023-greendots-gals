## Milestone 1

### Dataset<sup>1</sup>

- Energy: https://ourworldindata.org/energy 
- Renewable energy: https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy
- Fossil energy: https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels
- GreenGas energy: https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions
- Climate Change Impacts: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change


### Problematic

Energy now becomes a huge topic to be discussed in the current world. There are two main reasons. The first one is that the dominance of fossil fuels in our energy system drives climate change, and other health impacts such as air pollution. The second one is that due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the world, especially in Europe, is experiencing a lack of fossil fuels. As a result, the development of renewable and clean energy is important and agent. However, not every person has recognized the problems, so we need to show people that this problem is significant to arouse people’s awareness. 

First, we plan to show the energy consumption in each country to give the audience a direct sense of how much energy we are using. In addition, we plan to show the consumption of fossil fuels in each country. Second, we want to draw our audience’s attention on the climate change and greenhouse gas emissions trading to show the fact that we are facing significant environmental problems due to the high energy consumption. 

Then, we want to discover the potential power of using renewable energy in each country. Based on this target, we first want to show the trading and current share of renewable energy in overall energy consumption of each country. Later, we want to have a more detailed view on each sub-category renewable energy consumption situation. From here, we could analyze which countries have done a good job and which countries need to contribute more on the use of renewable energy.



### Exploratory Data Analysis

From the figures, we can see the global temperature and CO2 emission are generally synchronous. In the recent 60 years, CO2 emissions per capita five of main countries (in terms of CO2 emissions) has decreased in different levels. At the same time, fossil fuels consumption per capita is decreasing in slow process and renewables consumption per capita is increasing. In the last figure, we can different types of percentage of energy. Traditional energy still accounts for large proportions of the entire energy consumption.

### Related work


There are already some initial interpretations and visualizations available on the datasets we have chosen, such as line graphs and interactive map charts illustrating global temperature trends and energy consumption situations. While these visualizations present vast amounts of data, they only provide a preliminary insight into the energy landscape. Our aim is to use these datasets to tell a coherent data story that helps people understand the issues surrounding energy consumption and the environment.

We plan to select the most significant data elements and use interactive charts with visually appealing and simple designs to communicate our data story to the audience. Our approach goes beyond merely presenting data and aims to convey clear information to the audience, generate interest, and evoke empathy to raise awareness and prompt action.

Therefore, we will select the most relevant and impactful data elements and use interactive visualizations with a clear and logical narrative flow that effectively communicates our data story. Our approach not only presents data, but also aims to raise awareness and encourage action by conveying a compelling message that resonates with the audience.

One of our sources of inspiration is a website that presents a wide range of global information during the COVID-19 pandemic in a clear, visually appealing, and informative manner without overwhelming the viewer<sup>2</sup>.
